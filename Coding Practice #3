# Refresher for Random
import random
random.randint(0, 100) 

The provided code stub reads and integer, n, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i < n, print i ** 2.
Example
The list of non-negative integers that are less than n = 3  is [0, 1, 2]. Print the square of each number on a separate line.
Outcome: 
0
1
4

Solution:

c = 0 
    
    while c != n: 
        print(c**2)
        c = c + 1

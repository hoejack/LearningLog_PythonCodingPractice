# Refresher for Random
import random
random.randint(0, 100) 

The provided code stub reads and integer, n, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i < n, print i ** 2.
Example
The list of non-negative integers that are less than n = 3  is [0, 1, 2]. Print the square of each number on a separate line.
Outcome: 
0
1
4

Solution:

c = 0 
    
    while c != n: 
        print(c**2)
        c = c + 1

Q: 
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

total = sum(list(n for n in range(0,1000) if n % 3 == 0 or n % 5 == 0))
print(total)
233168

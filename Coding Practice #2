Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

If  n is odd, print Weird
If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  n is even and greater than , print Not Weird

Solution: 

def weird(n):
  if n % 2 > 0:
          print("Weird")
      elif n % 2 == 0 and n in range(2,6):
          print("Not Weird")
     elif n % 2 == 0 and n in range(6, 21):
          print("Weird")
      else: 
          print("Not Weird")
